We suggest that you **do not** run our code, as the data are quite largeâ€”as such, the program will take time to complete. However, do check out our code, which includes a `Jupyter` notebook highlighting our multithreaded spearman coefficient calculations. We also have `R` files wherein we wrangle data to fit our needs.

Check out our paper, a `pdf` version of which is in the repository.
